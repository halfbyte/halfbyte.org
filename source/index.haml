%h2 engineer. developer. craftsman. artist.
:markdown
  I (halfbyte aka Jan Krutisch) am an **engineer** by education, a **developer** by profession, 
  a **craftsman** by endurance and an **artist** by night.
  
  I **create** things and virtual things in the vague space between **technology**
  and **arts**.
  
  I like to **play** around with all kinds of **interesting** technologies, but I am currently 
  rooted (but not restricted to) in both **web development** (back to front) and **electronics**.
  
  I like to **help** other people creating (virtual) things. That's what I do for a **living**.
